Hi wardens
Am am @HaCk0 one of the developers of the Aragon core contracts (Aragon OSx). Thanks for your efforts already and I am looking forward to nice and clever findings.
The documentation can be found here: https://devs.aragon.org/docs/osx or on the staging environment (slightly newer) https://devs-stg.aragon.org/docs/osx
To get fully up to date docs install the dependencies in the contracts package `packages/contracts` with `yarn` and then generated the documentation with `yarn run docgen`

In scoping details it is written that test coverage is 60%. I just ran `npx hardhat coverage` and it showed some different results. Showing test coverage of more than 80%. That 60 is a typo? Anyone else ran hardhat coverage, what you are getting?
wanted to confirm it bcz I'm getting a hardhat error, maybe this can be the reason it is showing me a different result? 
```
Error in plugin solidity-coverage: :x: 1 test(s) failed under coverage.
HardhatPluginError: :x: 1 test(s) failed under coverage.

For any who are confusing to set up the repo locally and running the test:
1. clone the repo
2. `yarn install` on the root directory (`/2023-03-aragon`)
3. cd to `packages/contracts/`
4. now you are ready to run `npx hardhat [command]`

While using app.aragon.org and creating a DAO with it, what all plugins are associated with the DAO by default when creating?


[03/04/2023 19:46] giorgi3661
Hey. I dont get the question. If you use wallet based dao, it deploys dao and installs multisig right away. If you use token based, it deploys dao with token voting plugin installed


[03/04/2023 19:49] ne0n239
Ok. So these are the TokenVoting.sol and Multisig.sol, right? What is the Admin.sol plugin used for?


[03/04/2023 19:50] giorgi3661
Hey. What would make this high finding ? It is a typo in the docs that bears no risk at all.


[03/04/2023 19:51] giorgi3661
Well, if user wants none of those plugins, we will soon add an option to create dao with admin plugin where only he will have the power to do stuff on the dao without any proposals or whatever

[03/05/2023 11:58] co0nan
@HaCk0  can you give me an example of `DAOSettings calldata _daoSettings, PluginSettings[] calldata _pluginSettings` for `createDao` function


[03/05/2023 11:59] co0nan
not sure what should I pass for _pluginSettings


[03/05/2023 12:04] .hack0
`_daoSettings`
```json
{
  "daoURI": "0x00",
  "metadata": "0x00",
  "subdomain": "eagle",
  "trustedForwarder": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
}
```


[03/05/2023 12:12] .hack0
`_pluginSettings` consists of 2 parts:
1. the plugin setup reference (aka `pluginSetupRef`)
2. and the data that is passed to the plugin setup during preparation

`_pluginSettings` for a multisig plugin:
```json
[{
  "pluginSetupRef": {
    "pluginSetupRepo": "0x9b32224935b6BFD17c92305166ce0919e77c8cd9",
    "versionTag": {
      "build": 1,
      "release": 1
    }
  },
  "data": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000060000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001000000000000000000000000d92fe8b91ab9ec967ec4208eac1d4ea625cdff03"
}]
```

to get the abi for the data part checkout the `build-metadata.json` file for the plugin you want to install (for the multisig plugin it would be `packages/contracts/src/plugins/governance/multisig/build-metadata.json`)
there you see the `prepareInstallation` abi, which represents the abi used to decode the `_data` parameter of the function `prepareInstallation` in the corresponding plugin setup (for multisig the setup is `packages/contracts/src/plugins/governance/multisig/MultisigSetup.sol`)

[03/05/2023 12:40] co0nan
what is the difference between TokenVoting and AddressListVoting?


[03/05/2023 12:56] .hack0
token voting uses an erc20 token for membership control and address list a list of addresses


[03/05/2023 13:06] co0nan
so when we create a proposal on ERC20 it calls TokenVoting.createProposal, when does `createProposal` inside AddressListVoting get called?


[03/05/2023 13:15] .hack0
When you want to create a proposal call `createProposal` on either the TokenVotingPlugin or the AddresslistVotingPlugin.
**TokenVoting**
Depending on the settings either everyone or only token holder (addresses that hold a min. amount of the erc20 token configured for the TokenVotingPlugin) can create proposals. Calling `createProposal`
Only token holder (addresses that hold a min. amount of the erc20 token configured for the TokenVotingPlugin) can vote on the created proposal with 1 Token = 1 Vote

An example of an ERC20 token suitable for voting can be found here: `packages/contracts/src/token/ERC20/governance/GovernanceERC20.sol`

**AddresslistVoting**
Depending on the settings either everyone or only addresses in the memberlist can create proposals. Calling `createProposal`
Only addresses in the memberlist can vote on the create proposal with 1 address = 1 vote

For a deeper knowledge of the addresslist implementation I recommend reading the contract `packages/contracts/src/plugins/utils/Addresslist.sol`.

thankyou

In DAO.sol, users can deposit native tokens or any other tokens using function deposit(). But why users are going to do that? I mean where those funds are getting used? are those funds refundable? I can't find enough info about that in the docs or natspec. pls clarify

{Reactions}
üëç (2) ‚úÖ 

[03/06/2023 08:48] devabdee
The reason I was asking that was because the function is not storing the deposited funds info on the storage. Like in struct. Why its not bothering to store info like what token the user deposited, how many etc? It just simply emits an event. How it will be used then? And are those funds refundable?


[03/06/2023 08:50] .hack0
> Why its not bothering to store info like what token the user deposited
because an erc20 token can be transfered without the deposit function, thus the storage will always be wrong

> How it will be used then?
depends on the DAO how or where they wanna invest it

> And are those funds refundable?
depends on the DAO

Thank you fam


[03/07/2023 08:35] mheuer
I would take the closest look on the most difficult part: the `PluginSetupProcessor` and its two-step setup process (https://devs.aragon.org/docs/osx/how-it-works/framework/plugin-management/plugin-setup/).

First, it allows people to `prepare` an installation/update/uninstallation and request a list of permission operations (from/to the dao, plugin or other contract or wallet addresses). 

Second, the DAO calls `PluginSetupProcessor` for it to `apply` this list of permission operations. This commonly happens through a governance process (i.e., a proposal is created in, let's say, the TokenVoting plugin, and people have to agree to install/update/uninstall the plugin).

The first step gives DAO builders/auditors/tech-savy members time to review/audit the 
- plugin implementation 
- plugin setup contract 
- all other, associated contracts (that receive permissions or have access on the previous two).

The security concept is to create certainty/predictability that the permissions that were `prepared` are exactly the permissions that are `applied`. To assure this, a lot of hashing takes place in the `PluginSetupProcessor` (PSP).
If you would find ways / circumstances in which permissions can be applied that differ from those that were prepared / announced, that would certainly be an important finding.

Note, that we are aware of metamorphic contracts that can change their bytecode (https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/metamorphic-smart-contract-detector-tool/).
We expect that tooling is applied to untrusted plugin sources to check if the plugin setup or plugin implementation is metamorphic.

This is probably the cleanest codebase I've ever seen. üëç

presumably everything on this page is considered a known issue? https://devs.aragon.org/docs/osx/how-it-works/framework/plugin-management/plugin-setup/security-risk-mitigation

how are root permissions given to the PluginSetupProcessor when installing a plugin outside of the initial creation with DAOFactory?


[03/10/2023 16:32] .hack0
our SDK adds as a first and last action to grant and then revoke the root permissions from the PSP.
soo the actions array would look like this:
1. Grant root to PSP
2. Call applyInstallation on PSP
3. Revoke root from PSP

just that??

unique : )


[03/29/2023 17:48] devabdee
There were no High findings. So in that case unique Ms gets the best deal


[03/29/2023 17:48] eme0242
Ohh.. right!


[03/29/2023 17:48] devabdee
And sometimes even Unique Ms gets paid more than dup H

If you see the field that was added to the leaderboard the findings were just 4, all of them medium


[03/29/2023 17:52] devabdee
Looks like, You didn't focused on the QA and Gas report at all. Right?


[03/29/2023 17:53] carlitox477
No, I usually do, but the codebase was so solid that I did not give it a shot. No I regret a little about that, BC it would mean a solo first position, but the money is ok üòÇ


[03/29/2023 17:54] devabdee
Oh nice. Don't you think that helped you in finding the unique M?


[03/29/2023 17:55] carlitox477
Good knowledge of the basis, a little experience too. I can't tell much more given that the report is not public yet
