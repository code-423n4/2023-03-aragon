# Getting Started with the aragonOSx SDK

## Before you begin

The aragonOSx SDK is Javascript agnostic, which means you can use it with any Javascript framework, including popular ones like React, Vite, or Vue.

However, keep in mind that because server-side rendering is not supported yet for some crypto packages, you will not be able to use a framework like NextJS. Only frameworks that run entirely on client-side are supported.

Also know that all documentation within this site is done with Typescript. You can read more about [Typescript here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## Installing the SDK

First thing you want to do is install the aragonOSx SDK package into your product. You can do this by using `npm` or `yarn`.

```bash
npm install @aragon/sdk-client
```
or
```bash
yarn add @aragon/sdk-client
```

## Setting up the context

Then, you'll want to set up the aragonOSx SDK context within your application to have access to the SDK functions. You can do this at any point within your app.

However, so you're not setting it up multiple times, we recommend you set it up as a [context hook](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/react-context-for-beginners/) within Javascript application if you're using a framework like React, Vue, or other, or within the entry file of your app.

// Make sure to always keep these private in a file that is not committed to your public repository.
export const IPFS_API_KEY: string = "ipfs-api-key";

export const contextParams: ContextParams = {
  // Choose the network you want to use. You can use "goerli" or "mumbai" for testing, "mainnet" for Ethereum.

  signer: new Wallet("private-key"),
  // Optional on "rinkeby", "arbitrum-rinkeby" or "mumbai"
  // Pass the address of the  `DaoFactory` contract you want to use. You can find it here based on your chain of choice: https://github.com/aragon/core/blob/develop/active_contracts.json

    {
      url:
        "https://subgraph.satsuma-prod.com/aragon/core-goerli/api"
    }
  ]
};

// Instantiate the Aragon SDK context
export const context: Context = new Context(contextParams);

/* MARKDOWN
Update the context with new parameters if you wish to throughout your app.
*/

context.set({ network: 1 });
context.set({ signer: new Wallet("private key") }); // if you're using wagmi library, you can also get the signer through their [`useSigner` method](https://wagmi.sh/react/hooks/useSigner) inside a `useEffect` hook.
context.setFull(contextParams);
